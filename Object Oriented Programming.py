# Constructor:
# User can change the state of object(instance variable) using constructor
# Only one type of constructor is allowed in the class of an object.(ie-either default or parameterized)
# 1)Default Constructor:
# class Student:
#     def __init__(self):  # default constructor
#         print("Constructor invoked")
#
#     def show(self):
#         print("This is show fun")
#
#
# obj = Student()  # when we create an object of class the __init__ method is called by default by compiler/interpreter
# obj1 = Student()
# obj2 = Student()
# obj.show()
# obj1.show()
# obj2.show()
# ==============================================================================================================================================
# 2)Parameterized Constructor: Initially state to own value state we create parameterized constructor
# class student:
#     def __init__(self, m, n):  # Parameterized Constructor
#         self.a = m
#         self.b = n
#
#     def show(self):

# Python Object Oriented Programming -
#
# Python is a versatile programming language that supports various programming styles, including object-oriented programming (OOP)
# through the use of objects and classes.
#
# An object is any entity that has attributes and behaviors. For example, a parrot is an object. It has
#
# attributes - name, age, color, etc.
# behavior - dancing, singing, etc.
#
# Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.
#
# ___________________________________________________________________________
#
# Python Objects and Classes -
#
# An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions). Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.
#
# _________________________________________________________________________
#
# Python Classes -
#
# A class is considered as a blueprint of objects. We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house.
# It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.
#
# Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.
#
#
# Define Python Class-
#
# We use the class keyword to create a class in Python. For example,
#
#
# class ClassName:
#     # class definition
#
# Note: The variables inside a class are called attributes.
#
# __________________________________________________________
#
#
# Python Objects -
#
# An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose Bike is a class then we can create objects like bike1, bike2,
# etc from the class.
#
# # create class
# class Bike:
#     name = ""
#     gear = 0
#
# # create objects of class
# bike1 = Bike()
#
# ________________________________________________________
#
# Access Class Attributes Using Objects
# We use the . notation to access the attributes of a class. For example,
#
# # modify the name attribute
# bike1.name = "Mountain Bike"
#
# # access the gear attribute
# bike1.gear
# ______________________________________________________
#
# Example- Python Class and Objects
# # define a class
# class Bike:
#     name = ""
#     gear = 0
#
# # create object of class
# bike1 = Bike()
#
# # access attributes and assign new values
# bike1.gear = 11
# bike1.name = "Mountain Bike"
#
# print(f"Name: {bike1.name}, Gears: {bike1.gear} ")
#
# _________________________________________________________
#
# # define a class
# class Employee:
#     # define an attribute
#     employee_id = 0
#
# # create two objects of the Employee class
# employee1 = Employee()
# employee2 = Employee()
#
# # access attributes using employee1
# employee1.employeeID = 1001
# print(f"Employee ID: {employee1.employeeID}")
#
# # access attributes using employee2
# employee2.employeeID = 1002
# print(f"Employee ID: {employee2.employeeID}")
#
# _________________________________________________________________________
# Constructor -
#
# Constructor is a special method used to create and initialize an object of a class. On the other hand, a destructor
# is used to destroy the object.
#
# 1.The constructor is executed automatically at the time of object creation.
#
# 2. The primary use of a constructor is to declare and initialize data member/ instance variables of a class.
#
# Syntax of a constructor -
#
# def init(self):
#     # body of the constructor
#
# Important Points -
#
# 1. def: The keyword is used to define function.
#
# 2. init() Method: It is a reserved method. This method gets called as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
#
# 3. self: The first argument self refers to the current object. I
#
#
# Note:
#
# For every object, the constructor will be executed only once. For example, if we create four objects, the constructor is called four times.
#
# In Python, every class has a constructor, but itâ€™s not required to define it explicitly. Defining constructors in class is optional.
#
# Python will provide a default constructor if no constructor is defined.
#
# _________________________________________________________________________
# Types of Constructors -
#
# In Python, we have the following three types of constructors.
#
# Default Constructor
# Non-parametrized constructor
# Parameterized constructor
#
# Default Constructor -
#
# Python will provide a default constructor if no constructor is defined. Python adds a default constructor when we do not
# include the constructor in the class or forget to declare it. It does not perform any task but initializes the objects.
# It is an empty constructor without a body.
#
# Non-Parametrized Constructor -
#
# A constructor without any arguments is called a non-parameterized constructor.
# This type of constructor is used to initialize each object with default values.
#
# Parameterized Constructor -
#
# A constructor with defined parameters or arguments is called a parameterized constructor.
# We can pass different values to each object at the time of creation using a parameterized constructor.
